# Dev-Sweater-Back

## Application

This is our team project Dev-Sweater e-commerce site. This application was broken into two parts: `Dev-Sweater-Front` & `Dev-Sweater-Back`. The `Dev-Sweater-Front` was designed to communicate with `Dev-Sweater-Back` API, so that a user can go through the process of purchasing a product.

## Important Links

- `Dev-Sweater-Back` is deployed [here](https://dev-sweater-back.herokuapp.com/)

## Planning Story

We started by creating the ERD, Wireframes and SCRUM planning for the project. We then created the **_Backend_** of the application before moving to the **_Frontend_** to confirm my API routes were working. Lastly, we deployed both parts of the application and added styling.
